# Kusaba X Database Migration

## About
This script pulls board information, posts and images from an already existing [Kusaba X][k] installation and replicates them in [Tinyboard][o]. It should be helpful for those who already use Kusaba X][k], and want to switch over to Tinyboard.
[o]: http://tinyboard.org/
[k]: http://kusabax.cultnet.net/

## Requirements
 1. [Tinyboard][o] >= v0.9.2

## Use
 1. Install Tinyboard (>= v0.9.2) normally.
 2. Download and place `kusabax.php` in the root folder of Tinyboard.
 3. Edit the script and fill in your Kusaba X configuration. You can find KU_RANDOMSEED from Kusaba X's config.php file.
 4. Run the script in a web browser.
