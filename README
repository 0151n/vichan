Tinyboard - A lightweight PHP imageboard.


## Installation
* Tinyboard requires a MySQL database and a user to work. Create one.
* Import 'install.sql' into the database
  using phpMyAdmin
   OR
  mysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASE < install.sql
* Edit 'inc/config.php' to suit your installation
* Make sure that the directories used by TinyBoard are writable. Depending on your setup, you may need to chmod the directories to 777.
  The default directories are
	- /res
	- /src
	- /thumb
  You will also need to chmod the root directory so that static HTML files like index.html can be made.
* Ensure everything is okay by running test.php in a browser. The script will try and help you correct your errors.
* Run the post.php script. It should create an index.html and redirect you to it if everything is okay.
* Optional (highly recommended): Delete test.php and perhaps install.sql and this README
